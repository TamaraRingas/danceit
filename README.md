# danceit

A WebApp that allows users to search, store, and annotate metadata of African dance videos on YouTube. Made with the Django framework. 

It is recommended to run this in a python virtual environment, here is a guide to set one up if you haven't: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment

To use the YouTube search functionality, create a key for the API through YouTube and add it to the bottom line of the settings.py file. 

Type "python3 manage.py runserver" into the terminal of the dance-it directory.
The webapp will start on the local server with a message like "Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/" 
Follow the url link or copy the url into any browser to start the site. 

Press control-c to exit the server.
